Welcome to Solar Quest, a 2D platformer centered around the theme of sustainable cities. This game was created for ITCS 4230 at UNC Charlotte by the team Responsible Armchair. 

Follow our main character, Rob, as he solves puzzles and fights enemies to fix the solar tower and save the humans.

Solar Quest uses WASD for movement, arrow keys for gun orientation, and space to shoot.

Once you start a quest, you are timed, so race to get the fastest time, and save as many humans as possible!

Enjoy the game!
